This tarball contains two other files:

   NCSU-FreePDK15-1.2.tgz      (the kit)
   NCSU-FreePDK15-1.2.tgz.sig  (signature file)

The signature file allows you to verify the integrity of
the kit file using a command such as:

   gpg --verify NCSU-FreePDK15-1.2.tgz.sig

For more information on kit verification see this web page:

To unpack the kit use a command like:

   tar xzf NCSU-FreePDK15-1.2.tgz

There is a file named README in the top level directory that
will get you started.
